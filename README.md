This is my take on the project proposed by The Odin Project.
The idea is to create a basic website using HTML (for now) that contains recipes.

Up until now, I know how to create pages, how to include images, links, headings with different sizes, paragraphs, how to make something **bold** or *italic*, and how to create ordered ans unordered lists.

We'll see what I will learn to do at the end ;)
