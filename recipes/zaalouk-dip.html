        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Morocco’s favourite way to make the most out of aubergines is without a doubt Zaalouk! In the recipe, we are making a delicious dip based on my classic Zaalouk recipe. Easy and comforting, it’s definitely a crowd pleaser.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large aubergines (600g)</li>
                <li>4 medium tomatoes (320g), seeded and chopped</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li>3 garlic cloves, minced or pressed</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons paprika</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon caster sugar</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove 3 vertical strips of skin from each aubergine. Discard the vertical strips and cut the aubergines in large cubes.</li>
                <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan and add the aubergines, tomatoes, garlic, paprika, cumin, salt and sugar. Cover over medium-low heat until the vegetables are soft, about 25 to 35 minutes. Stir occasionally to make sure the vegetables don’t stick to the pan. </li>
                <li>Uncover, mash the vegetables and leave over medium heat until all liquids evaporate. Keep the zaalouk in the fridge for up to 4 days and serve at room temperature.</li>
                <li>To make the coriander oil, combine coriander, olive oil, vinegar, salt and sugar in a food processor and process until very finely minced. Taste and adjust the seasoning with salt and sugar if necessary.</li>
                <li>To serve, spread the zaalouk in a shallow plate, garnish with the feta, coriander oil, sliced onions and a generous drizzle of olive oil.</li>
            </ol>
